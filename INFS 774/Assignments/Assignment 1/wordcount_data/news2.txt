Banking giant JPMorgan Chase used to be the golden child of Wall Street.
But the company disappointed investors Wednesday by reporting fourth quarter profits and revenue that was below forecasts -- largely due to increased legal costs.
And CEO Jamie Dimon continues to show resentment about how much scrutiny his bank has come under from various government agencies.
During a conference call with reporters, Dimon said that the bank was "under assault" by regulators. When asked for more details on that, he responded by saying, "You've got to be kidding me."
To be sure, JPMorgan Chase is hardly struggling. The bank reported a $4.9 billion profit in the fourth quarter.
Still, that was down 7% from a year ago and translated to $1.19 a share. Analysts were expecting earnings of $1.31 a share.
Profits were weighed down by $1.1 billion in legal expenses during the quarter.
The bank, along with some of its rivals, has been accused by federal regulators around the world of manipulating the foreign-exchange markets. JPMorgan Chase settled some of those charges in November.
Revenue fell 2% from the fourth quarter of 2013 as well.
There are concerns throughout the industry about how increased regulations and calls to boost capital requirements will make these firms far less profitable in the future.
