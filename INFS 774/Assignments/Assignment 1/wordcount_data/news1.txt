JPMorgan Chase on Wednesday reported an unexpected drop in profit during a sluggish fourth quarter.
The bank said its earnings fell 7 percent, to $4.9 billion, or $1.19 a share, from $5.6 billion, or $1.30 a share, in the period a year earlier. The most recent results fell short of the $1.31 a share expected by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.
Net revenue at the bank dropped 3 percent, to $22.5 billion, from the fourth quarter of 2013. On a so-called managed basis, revenue was $23.55 billion, slightly below the $23.6 billion anticipated by analysts.
The bank’s shares were down 4 percent in midmorning trading.
For 2014 as a whole, JPMorgan reported profit of $21.8 billion, a 21 percent increase and the highest ever annual profit for the company.
The bank’s quarterly profit was hurt by $900 million in new legal expenses, or $1.1 billion on a pretax basis, as the company prepared to settle an investigation into manipulation of the foreign currency markets by the big banks. These are the latest big legal costs being absorbed by JPMorgan in the wake of the financial crisis.
